I split the html file into the "lessons" for easier consumption (see `/split_lessons/`). I found the original html did not display nicely on my phone, so a reformatted the lesson files (see `/formatted_lessons/`). For each reformatted lesson file, I add the translations for the "SENTENCES FOR TRANSLATION" to the bottom of the document, (see `/added_translation/`). These translations are from google translate and there is no guarantee that they are correct. Some of the translations are not in the spirit the author intended (for example in lesson 4 the author introduces the word 'apud' _near_, but google uses 'proksime de' in the sentence translations instead of the intended 'apud').
